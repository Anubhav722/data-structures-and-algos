Introduction to cassandra archtecture
It is a peer to peer architecture.

- The architecture of cassandra contributes to a database that scales and performs with continuous availability.
- It has a masterless "ring" distributed architecture that is elegant, and easy to setup and maintain.
- built for scale architecture is capable of handling large amts of data and 1000's of concurrent users/operations per second, across muliple data centers easily.


CASSANDRA ARCHITECTURE LAYERS:

- Top layers
- middle layer
- core layer

responsibilies

CORE LAYER - messaging service, gossip protocol, cluster state, partitioner, replication

MIDDLE LAYER - commitlog, memtable, SStable, indexes, compaction, 

TOP LAYER - tombstones, hintedhandoff, readrepair, bootstrap, monitoring, admintools
