# Binary Search is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.

# Three cases arise while performing binary search.

Let us consider we need to find x in the sorted array A.

Case 1: x == A[mid]

Case 2: x < A[mid]

Case 3: x > A[mid]

We have `start_index` and `end_index`.

where, mid = (start_index + end_index)/2

# Time Complexity

Best Case: O(1)

Worst Case: O(logn)
