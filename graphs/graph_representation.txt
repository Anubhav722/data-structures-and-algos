### can be represented by two dynamic arrays.
1. vertex list
2. edge list

edges: class Edge {
	string startVertex;
	string endVertex;
}

if the graph is weighted

edges: class Edge {
	string startVertex;
	string endVertex;
	int weight;
}


### Another way to store graph can be a 2d array.

Considered good for dense graph i.e. graph having edges close to v**2 (where v is the vertices).
Sparse graph should not be implemented using this method. (far less from v**2 edges.)

Finding adjacent elements to a given node: O(v)
Finding if two nodes are connected or not : O(1) + O(v)

If we use hash table to store the vertices and it's respected array index. then the above time complexity can be reduced to O(1)
