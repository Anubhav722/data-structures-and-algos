A graph (G) is an ordered pair of a set of (V) vertices and a set of edges (E).

-----------
|G = (V, E) |
-----------

ORDERED PAIR (a, b)

(a, b) is not equal to (b, a).
they can only be equal if a = b

unordered pair is represented as {a, b}

{a, b} = {b, a}


EDGES OF GRAPH

1. directed edge - connection can be one way (ordered pair)
2. undirected edge - connection can be two way (unordered pair)

GRAPHS CAN BE CLASSIFIED ON THE BASIS OF GRAPHS. (directed graphs and undirected graphs)

TREES ALWAYS HAVE DIRECTED EDGES (one of the connection would be origin and the other the destination)

EXAMPLES WHERE graph is implemented.

1. Social network (like facebook).
 A user would be a node in the graph and the edges will be connecting him to a friend (undirected graph)
 User suggestions usually come via graph (friends of friends)

 Similar question could be: Find all the nodes having length of shortest path from a given node equal to 2


2. Interlinked web pages on the internet (WWW)
 is direct represented graph. A web page that would have a unique address or url would be the node in a graph.

 So for example if I have put a hyperlink on my web page I can go to the web page (wikipedia) for instance.
 But wikipedia hasn't given hyperlink to come back to my page.

3. Search engines (google) use web crawling.
 Web crawling is basically graph traversal or in simpler words, act of visiting all the nodes in a graph

WEIGHTED AND UNWEIGHTED GRAPHS

WEIGHTED EDGES - we associate some weight to the edges.

UNWEIGHTED GRAPHS - a weighted graph with all edges having weight = 1 unit

|V| -> no of vertices
|E| -> no of edges

An edge is called a self loop if it involves only 1 vertex.
If both endpoints of the edge are same then it's called self loop.

An edge is called a multi edge if it occurs more than once in a graph.
we can have a multi edge in both directed and undirected graph.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Maximum no. of edges in a directed graph with n vertices (n) would be equal to = n * (n -1) | TRUE ONLY IF THERE IS NO SELF LOOP OR MULTI EDGE LOOP

Maximum no. of edges in a undirected graph with n vertices (n) would be equal to = (n * (n -1)) / 2 | TRUE ONLY IF THERE IS NO SELF LOOP OR MULTI EDGE LOOP

A walk (path also) in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair in the sequence is connected by an edge.

A path is called a simple path if no vertices (and thus no edges) are repeated.

Trail: A walk in which no edges are repeated

Strongly connected graph: If there is a path from any vertex to any other vertices.

Closed walk: Starts and ends at the same vertex.
